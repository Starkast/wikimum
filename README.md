Next Generation Wikimum!

_This application is under active development and should not be used in production yet_.

## Development

These instructions assume you are using OS X.

Install prerequisites

    brew install postgresql
    brew install cmake
    bundle install

Ruby gems are vendored into `vendor/cache`, you should always check in the gems when changing gems. The caching is set up with [`bundle package --all`](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-package.1.html).

### Database setup

Make sure PostgreSQL is running

    postgres

Get a copy of the production database

    dotenv rake db:pull

### Start the app

    foreman start

Go to [http://wikimum.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080](http://wikimum.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080) (the GitHub app for development is configured with this address).

# Development and production
DATABASE_URL=postgres://
GITHUB_BASIC_CLIENT_ID=

## History

This wiki software was originally developed by [Johan Eckerstr√∂m](http://github.com/jage) at IMUM HB back in 2005. When we killed the company the software was kept running at [Starkast](http://wiki.starkast.net/) but not much work was done on it. Originally a Rails (1.x) app, it's now a Sinatra based application.
