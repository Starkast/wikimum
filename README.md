## History

This wiki software was originally developed by [Johan Eckerstr√∂m](http://github.com/jage) at IMUM HB back in 2005. When we killed the company the software was kept running at [Starkast](http://wiki.starkast.net/) but not much work was done on it. Originally a Rails (1.x) app, it's now a Sinatra based application.
